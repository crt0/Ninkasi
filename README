Ninkasi
=======

Ninkasi is a web-based volunteer registration system for BJCP homebrew
and professional beer competitions.  The Ninkasi module currently also
builds the Brewers' Cup web site.

Ninkasi uses the Template Toolkit <http://template-toolkit.org/> to
pre-process content in the appropriate output format.  In most cases,
the format can be specified using the "format" query parameter in the
URL for the resource being requested.  Currently, HTML ("html"),
comma-separated value ("csv"), and plain text e-mail ("mail") formats
are supported.

The Template Toolkit is also used to pre-process the static HTML pages
that make up the Brewers' Cup web site.  This pre-processing happens
when the ./Build script is run, and "./Build install" installs the
static HTML files into the document root.
